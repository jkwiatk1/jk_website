## About Jan 

I am currently developing my competence in the field of **Artificial Intelligence**. In the past, I have been educated in **Power Electronics** and **Electrical Engineering**. I enjoy learning and actively spending my free time. I am ready to make difficult and risky decisions and can look at problems realistically.

Since I was young, I have been successfully engaged in sports: judo, cycling (won Polish track championship in 2015), gym, etc. 

I enjoy traveling, exploring the world and am interested in meeting new people.
